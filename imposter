# There is an imposter among us... I know how to find it 
I’m learning to live and embrace imposter syndrome, using cool tools

## Summary

-   Imposter syndrome is not about seniority, skills or time in the company. I still catch myself thinking that it is only a matter of time that someone will find that I’m faking it and fire me.
    
-   I discovered two great resources to embrace and live in peace with imposter syndrome: coaching and 30-60-90 days rolling planning. Here I’ll talk about the second one.
    
-   For this proposed process the fundamental basis is in the yearly planning, including a prioritization scale and RICE model.
    
-   Each month I spend 2 hours on updates:
    

-   One hour closing the month and filling out the review
    
-   One hour validating the next months and adding the why. If there are missing tickets I create new ones adding the “Task text” as Acceptance Criteria.
    

-   I am working on this with a lot of support, feedback and collaboration from my manager and my coach  . They are both splendid.
    
-   I've been doing this for 2 months and my imposter syndrome symptoms have reduced. :)
    

If you want more details on my 30-60-90 day rolling plan, welcome to my long post.

**## I’m the imposter… and seems that I’m not the only one

I’m Ale, I’ve been at Zapier for 3 years, and some days I still feel like a terrible imposter. In fact, my imposter syndrome at Zapier has become more pronounced. Why? I think it's because I'm surrounded by so many intelligent, inspiring, and talented people.

As soon as I noticed that [#fun-imposter-syndrome](https://zapier.slack.com/archives/CBF58KXC0) and [#fun-mental-health](https://zapier.slack.com/archives/C6MSBUE85) channels are super active, I realized: I’m not alone. A fellow Zapien explained that they think it's because we compare ourselves to others, only focusing on the skills they have, but we lack. I’ve learned that other Zapiens have compared themselves to me, and experienced imposter syndrome as well. Isn't it ironic? ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tXBVK46LH-VaRsLMRr5p7s8MFpXd1l3mdPV-QWiSXxUo9mIoO3LO6BkfFvyimT4ICaKBXsQFaK7zlluZjgmENbcTppeKfYlMenE4tLv6g03b9UdHZvi9uS7lfJVyYIYjtY6gC-i)

## Here the magic: Learning about 30-60-90 days rolling planning

During the March remote retreat [@muness](https://async.zapier.com/directory/profile/munesscastle) led a reading session that significantly improved my imposter syndrome. It was about the book “The First 90 Days” by Michael D. Watkins. The book really resonated with me. Here's a link to a great [summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2dATkRXDvThAV-BRcfD-5A0cJYZYHiC/view?usp=sharing). He introduced the rolling part during the session. The proposal was to move forward from the first day 90 in the company, and start doing that on an ongoing basis.

That means, the first time we plan 3 months (90 days). At the end of each month we should evaluate the month and plan another 30 days. With that, every month we will have 90 days planned ahead of us. I loved the idea at first sight. At that point I was just transferred to a new manager, having all my insecurities going wild, and I realized that I needed to plan to know where I was going, what I was doing, and how I was contributing to Zapier.

## How 2 hours a months is helping me to mitigate my Imposter Syndrome

I started working on my monthly planning - retro, looked at some templates, and shared with some colleagues. After looking at my colleagues' examples and having a few pairing sessions, I came up with my own template. My imposter syndrome hasn't fully gone away, but we’re at peace now and when I start having the familiar imposter syndrome feelings, I just look at my doc and I feel relieved..

I’m not saying that I hold the ultimate truth about imposter syndrome management. I just want to share how my document works. And sorry, I’m not an “Among Us” player, so I have no good tricks for the game. It was just a catchy title to invite you to read my post.

#### How rolling planning helped me get over my impostor syndrome (with free template)

I’ve been at Zapier for three years. I regularly feel like an impostor. 

You would think, after three years, that I would believe that I belong here, but no—if anything my imposter syndrome at Zapier has become more pronounced. Why? I think it's because I'm surrounded by so many intelligent, inspiring, and talented people. It's hard to believe you fit in among so many amazing people. 

One thing that made me feel better, though, is noticing two very active channels on our company's Slack—one about mental health in general, one about impostor syndrome specifically. That made me realize something: I’m not alone. 

The issue, a fellow employee told me, is that we all compare ourselves to others—but only focus on the skills others have but we don't. None of us knows everything, so thinking this way means all of us get to feel bad.

I’ve learned that other people here have compared themselves to me and also experienced imposter syndrome. Isn't it ironic? We both admire each other in a way that makes us think less of ourselves. 

#### Here's the magic: 30-60-90 days rolling planning

During a recent retreat Muness, one of my co-workers, introduced me to a book that significantly improved my imposter syndrome: The First 90 Days by Michael D. Watkins. It really resonated with me—here's a summary, if you're interested.

Muness, during a session, talked me through rolling planning. The idea is to start a rolling plan during the first 90 days you're at a new company, then to continually create more 90 day plans.

This is overwhelming, sorry. Let's back up, because it really is helpful. 

To begin, make a plan for the next three months—90 days. At the end of each month, evaluate how things went, then make a plan for the 30 days after your current plan. This way, at the end of every month, you have planned out 90 days. 

I can't tell you how much this clicked with me—I loved it at first sight. And the timing was perfect: I had just transferred to a new manager, my insecurities were all going wild, and I realized that I needed to plan to know where I was going, what I was doing, and how I was contributing to Zapier.

So I started planning.

#### How two hours a month mitigates my Imposter Syndrome

I started working on my monthly planning, and I really geeked out. I looked at some templates, and talked with some colleagues who already used this system. After looking at my colleagues' examples, and doing a few pairing sessions, I came up with my own template in Google Sheets, which allows me to add items to yearly planning and automatically populate them to a rolling 90 day plan. You can make a copy of it right now, if you want. As you can tell, it's fairly elaborate, but once you get the hang of it everything will click. 

My imposter syndrome hasn't fully gone away, but we’re at peace now. When I start having the familiar feelings, I just look at my doc and I feel relieved. It works for me. 

I’m not saying that I hold the ultimate truth about imposter syndrome management. I just want to share how my document works, and to give you a chance to try it out.
